# Current Progress

## Current Features

 - Dashboard - Display the currently available shows that I can watch
 - Rage support - Download and organizes season and episode metadata about your shows
 - NZB support - Support for searching configurable (torrent, nzb, etc) search sites for new episode availability




## Maybe Features (if someone asks nicely)
 - package TVR as a downloadable gem, executable or something that can be dropped (and run) on a local or remote media box
 - launch VLC to stream back to an embedded viewer, so you can 'play it her'
