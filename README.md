# TVR
A Sinatra based webapp for watching (like a TV) and managing (like a DVR) your favorite digital content.


## Disclaimer
*If you intend to use this application to manage illegally downloaded digital media ... you do so at your own risk.*


## History
This application is an extraction of part of an exising rails application I wrote for myself in my 
spare time to help me manage the shows I like to watch.

Q. Why not just make an adapter/plugin/whatever for something like XBMC?
A. Because this just seemed easier to me.
